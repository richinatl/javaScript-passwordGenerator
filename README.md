# javaScript-passwordGenerator

The goal was to create a password generator using javaScript.
A password generator is a very useful tool in many instances.
While this seemed like a simple idea at first glance I learned quite a bit from this project.

There were several ways to go about accomplishing the goal, after going through several options I decided to use ascii letter codes in an array, in my opinion that provided the simplest, cleanest implementation, as oppossed to creating individual strings of letters, numbers, and symbols.
